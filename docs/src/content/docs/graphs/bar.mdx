import EmbedChart from '../../../components/EmbedChart.astro';

Bar graph for displaying data as vertical bars. Bar graphs are ideal for comparing discrete values across different data points and showing magnitude with clear visual separation.

## Properties

### `valueKey`

**type:** `String`  
**required:** `true`

The value key in the data source to use for the bar's height.

When [`baseValue`](#basevalue) is null, the bar extends from the bottom of the graph area to the value. When [`baseValue`](#basevalue) is set, the bar extends from the base value to the value, which is useful for showing deviations from a baseline.

<h6>Example when `valueKey` set to `close` and `baseValue` is not set</h6>

<EmbedChart name="graph_bar1"/>

### `baseValue`
**type:** `double?`  
**required:** `false`  
**default:** `null`

Fixed base value for the bar's starting position. When set, bars extend from this base value to the value defined by [`valueKey`](#valuekey). This allows you to visualize differences from a specific threshold or zero line.

<h6>Example when `valueKey` set to `close` and `baseValue` set to `200`</h6>
