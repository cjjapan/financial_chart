import EmbedChart from '../../../components/EmbedChart.astro';

Area graph for displaying data as filled regions. Area graphs are useful for showing magnitude over time and can visualize the space between two values or between a value and a baseline.

## Properties

### `valueKey`

**type:** `String`  
**required:** `true`

The value key in the data source to use for the area's top boundary.

When both [`baseValueKey`](#basevaluekey) and [`baseValue`](#basevalue) are null, the area fills from the value down to the bottom of the graph area. When either is specified, the area fills between the value and the base value.

<h6>Example when both `baseValueKey` and `baseValue` are not set</h6>

<EmbedChart name="graph_area1"/>

### `baseValue`
**type:** `double?`  
**required:** `false`  
**default:** `null`

Fixed base value for the area's bottom boundary. When set, the area fills between the value defined by [`valueKey`](#valuekey) and this fixed value. This is useful for highlighting deviations from a specific threshold.

<h6>Example when `valueKey` set to `high` and `baseValue` set to `200`</h6>

<EmbedChart name="graph_area2"/>

### `baseValueKey`
**type:** `String?`   
**required:** `false`   
**default:** `null`  

The value key in the data source to use as the area's bottom boundary. When set, the area fills between the values defined by [`valueKey`](#valuekey) (top) and this key (bottom). This is useful for visualizing ranges or bands between two data series.

<h6>Example when `valueKey` set to `high` and `baseValueKey` set to `low`</h6>
