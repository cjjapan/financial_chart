import EmbedChart from '../../../components/EmbedChart.astro';

Line graph for displaying data as a continuous line connecting data points. Line graphs are excellent for showing trends, patterns, and changes over time.

## Properties

### `valueKey`

**type:** `String`  
**required:** `true`

The value key in the data source to use for the line.

<h6>Example when `valueKey` set to `close`</h6>

<EmbedChart name="graph_line1"/>

### `smoothing`
**type:** `bool`  
**required:** `false`   
**default:** `false`

Whether to apply curve smoothing to the line. When enabled, the line uses smooth curves instead of straight segments between data points, creating a more fluid appearance. This is particularly useful for visualizing data with natural continuity.

<h6>Example when `smoothing` set to `true`</h6>

<EmbedChart name="graph_line2"/>
